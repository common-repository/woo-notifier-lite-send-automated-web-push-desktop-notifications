Increase sales and customer engagement with the help of web push notifications. Boost sales of your WooCommerce store via web push notifications. Powered by Googleï¿½s Firebase platform.

== Description ==

Do you want to boost your customer engagement to a whole new level?

Do you want to convert your occasional web store visitors to loyal customers?

It is now possible to achieve this, with the power of push notifications for web browsers.

Until now, building mobile apps was the only way to deliver push notifications and increase user engagement. But mobile apps are expensive to build, and you can now offer the same feature with your web store and on the desktop and mobile platforms (Android at the moment, iOS is coming soon) with a single solution.

WooNotifier is a nifty plugin to alert all your woocommerce store visitors about new product launches, price-drops, coupons and much more, all via web push notification for Google Chrome (Windows/OSX/Android) and Firefox (Windows).

Once installed and configured, the plugin auto-sends push notifications to all users who have allowed web push notification for a WooCommerce store. Admin user can also send custom web push notification manually.
